Welcome to PyLaDe's documentation!
==================================

**PyLaDe** is a lightweight language detection tool written in Python. The tool provides a ready-to-use command-line interface, along with a more complex scaffolding for customized tasks.

The current version of PyLaDe implements the *Cavnar-Trenkle N-Gram-based approach*. However, the tool can be further expanded with customized language identification implementations.

If you just want to detect the language of a text, here is what you came for:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fievelk/PyLaDe.git
cd pylade
pip install .
pylade "Put text here"
# en
```

If you want to train your own model, use a custom language detection implementation and obtain any other information about installing and using PyLaDe, you can find up-to-date instructions on the [project repository README](https://github.com/fievelk/pylade).

If you are looking for technical information about models, classes and methods, please refer to the table of contents below.
